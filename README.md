## 🔍 End-to-End RAG System Architecture (Basic to Advanced)

![RAG System Overview](Method1/rag%20system.png)

This diagram provides a comprehensive overview of an end-to-end **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system — ranging from basic components to more advanced techniques. It is structured into five key stages:

### 1. 🏗️ Query Construction
- Converts natural language questions into structured queries for different databases.
- Supports:
  - **Text-to-SQL** for Relational DBs
  - **Text-to-Cypher** for Graph DBs
  - **Self-query Retriever** for Vector DBs

### 2. 🧠 Query Translation
- Enhances retrieval performance by transforming the question using:
  - **Multi-query**
  - **RAG-Fusion**
  - **Decomposition**
  - **Step-back**
  - **HyDE**

### 3. 🔀 Routing
- Dynamically determines the optimal retrieval path:
  - **Logical routing** – chooses the appropriate database.
  - **Semantic routing** – selects the best prompt based on similarity.

### 4. 🗂️ Indexing
- Prepares and structures data for efficient retrieval using:
  - **Semantic Splitters** – optimize chunking.
  - **Dense Representations** – compact retrieval units.
  - **Fine-tuned Embeddings** – specialized models like CoLBERT.
  - **Hierarchical Indexing** – tree-based summaries (e.g., RAPTOR).

### 5. 🔄 Retrieval & Generation
- Uses relevance-based document filtering and response generation:
  - **Ranking** via Re-Rank, RankGPT, RAG-Fusion.
  - **Refinement** and **Active Retrieval** through CRAG.
  - **Self-RAG** and **RRR** for high-quality, context-aware answer generation.

This visual and modular breakdown helps developers and researchers understand the building blocks of a modern RAG pipeline — from query routing to advanced re-ranking and retrieval-based generation techniques.
